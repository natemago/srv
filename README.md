HTTP Application Server
========================

*srv* is small application server written in Python.
It can be used to just serve files/resource back to you when you want to test 
your JavaScript code / HTML design; to implement simple logic for handling of
your requests and you don't want to setup full-featured application server.

The server is intended to be "one-liner" - should work reasonably well if 
started without any configuration and without command line arguments.


Installing
----------

There is no installing. Just download the "srv.py" file and make sure you have
Python installed (python 3+).
Then copy to the folder where the files that you want to server are located.

Running
-------
From command line: 

`./srv.py`

(or optionally):

`python3 srv.py`
